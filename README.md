## Daily Bike Rentals and Profit Analysis
In this project, I will be working on data come from a company that facilitates bike-sharing, a user can rent a bike from one place and return it to another. My goal is to understand and predict daily bike rentals using linear regression. Also, this project helped me practice my exploratory analysis skills.
